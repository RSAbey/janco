# Finance Report Download - Issue Fixed

## Problem
When clicking the "Download Report" button, the system was logging users out instead of generating and downloading the PDF report.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Backend Implementation**: There was no backend endpoint to generate PDF reports
2. **Frontend Not Making API Calls**: The DownloadReportForm component was just showing a form without actually processing the download
3. **API Interceptor Issue**: The apiClient was redirecting to login page on any 401 error, even during file downloads

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New Files Created:
- **`backend/controllers/reportController.js`**: Handles PDF generation with pdfkit
- **`backend/routes/reports.js`**: Defines the report generation endpoint

#### Modified Files:
- **`backend/server.js`**: Added the new `/api/reports` route

#### PDF Structure:
The generated PDF now includes:

**Header Section:**
- Left side:
  - Company name: "Janco Home & Construction (Pvt) Ltd." (18pt, Bold)
  - Subtitle: "Architectural Designing and Construction" (12pt)
  - Address: "458/1 High Level Road, Pannipitiya." (9pt)
  - Phone numbers: "011 20 900 90 | 070 60 900 92 | 70 60 900 93 | 077 12 873 74"
  - Emails: "jancohomearch@gmail.com | info@jancohome.com"
  - Website: "jancohome.com"
  
- Right side:
  - Company logo (100px width) from `/public/logo.png`

**Content Section:**
- Horizontal line separator
- Report title: "Financial Report" (centered, 16pt)
- Date range and generation timestamp
- Summary section with:
  - Total Income (green text)
  - Total Expenses (red text)
  - Net Balance (green/red based on positive/negative)
- Detailed transactions table with columns:
  - Date
  - Section
  - Description
  - Income (green, right-aligned)
  - Expense (red, right-aligned)

**Footer Section:**
- Watermark text: "This is a generated document from Janco Home & Construction Management System" (8pt, italic, gray, centered)

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Modified Files:
- **`src/Finance/DownloadReportForm.js`**: Complete rewrite with proper functionality
  - Added state management for form data
  - Added validation for report type and date range
  - Implemented proper API call with blob response handling
  - Added custom date range option
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Automatic file download trigger after successful generation

- **`src/services/apiClient.js`**: Fixed the logout issue
  - Updated response interceptor to skip redirect on blob responses
  - This prevents users from being logged out during file downloads

- `pdfkit`: For PDF generation
- `axios`: Already existed but used for backend logo fetching if needed
